Voltage = A difference in electrical potential (pressure)

Current = Rate at which electrons flow though a given point

Resistance = Opposition to the flow of electricity

Voltage is like the difference in height.

Current is like the rate of flow through a pipe.

Resistance is a bit like a narrowing in a pipe, that causes a change in current.
